Scenario: Wallet recovery with connected base node staying online
    Given I have a seed node NODE
    And I have 1 base nodes connected to all seed nodes
    And I have wallet WALLET_A connected to all seed nodes
    And I have a merge mining proxy PROXY connected to NODE and WALLET_A with default config
    When I merge mine 10 blocks via PROXY
    When I mine 5 blocks on NODE
    When I wait for wallet WALLET_A to have at least 55000000000 uT
    Then all nodes are at height 15
    When I recover wallet WALLET_A into wallet WALLET_B connected to all seed nodes
    Then wallet WALLET_A and wallet WALLET_B have the same balance
